== Development instructions

=== Code Design

The project is based on

- Electron + NodeJS (the required version of NodeJS >= `v12`.)
- Typescript
- React + Redux
- Rust for some modules

=== Setup Environments

==== Install System Libs

You need `libudev`, `libusb-1.0-0`, `libusb-1.0-0-dev` installed on Linux

.On Ubuntu:
----
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
----

==== Install NPM packages

.Install development tools
----
npm install -g node-gyp lerna yarn
----

.For windows run also:
----
npm install -g npm windows-build-tools@4.0.0
----

.Install dependencies:
----
yarn install
----

=== Run for development

.Build sources
----
yarn run build
----

Optionally you can build desktop app with automatic rebuild on change.
Please note that it rebuilds only main Desktop module, and you have responsibility to rebuild other modules manually when changed.

.Continuous rebuild of Desktop (optional):
----
lerna run build:watch
----

.or
----
yarn workspace @emeraldwallet/desktop run build:watch
----

.Start Electron application:
----
lerna run start
----

.or
----
yarn workspace @emeraldwallet/desktop start
----

=== Troubleshooting

==== Cleanup

If you're facing some weird problem it makes sense to make a full cleanup and then rebuild everything from scratch.

.To erase NPM modules (may be needed when you build under different NodeJS version):
----
yarn run clean:node_modules
----

.Erase compiled Javascript (it's also done automatically on `build`):
----
yarn clean
----

==== Emerald Vault module error

Electron may show error, like:

> _[emerald-vault-native] was compiled against a different Node.js version using NODE_MODULE_VERSION 64. This version of Node.js requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 69. Please try re-compiling or re-installing the module (for instance, using npm rebuild or npm install)_

At this case you'll need to recompile Emerald Vault for your platform and version of Electron.
You will need to have Rust
compiler and LLVM installed, please follow instructions on:

- https://rustup.rs/
- http://releases.llvm.org/download.html

After installing Rust and LLVM run following to recompile the module:
----
export RUSTFLAGS=-C target-feature=+crt-static
npm run build:neon
----

=== Logs

Electron and Emerald logs persisted in:

 * OSX: `~/Library/Logs/EmeraldWallet/log.log`
 * Linux: `~/.config/EmeraldWallet/log.log`

=== Building distributions in development

You can run a distribution build in your development environment.Assuming
you've already compiled `./src/` and `./electron/`, you'll be able to run:

----
yarn build:dist
----

This command will build for _your current system_.
Note that there are configurations for several systems (OSX, Linux, Windows) specified in the `"build"` field of `package.json`, but the `dist` command will by default only build for the system it's on.

NOTE: If you're developing on OSX and have a developer signing identity on your machine, you can optionally disable that with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`.

OSX is also able to build for Linux.
Add `-ml` to that raw command to build for both OSX and Linux at the same time.

=== Troubleshooting

Some preliminary things to try in case you run into issues:

Clear out any persisted settings or userdata from previous trials

- OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/EmeraldWallet`
- Linux: `~/.config/EmeraldWallet`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\EmeraldWallet`
